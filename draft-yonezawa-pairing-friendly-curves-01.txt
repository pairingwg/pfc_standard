1.  Introduction

1.1.  Pairing-Based Cryptography

   Elliptic curve cryptography is one of the important areas in recent
   cryptography.  The cryptographic algorithms based on elliptic curve
   cryptography, such as ECDSA, is widely used in many applications.

   Pairing-based cryptography, a variant of elliptic curve cryptography,
   is attracted the attention for its flexible and applicable
   functionality.  Pairing is a special map defined over elliptic

   curves.  As the importance of pairing grows, elliptic curves where
   pairing is efficiently computable are studied and the special curves
   called pairing-friendly curves are proposed.

   Thanks to the characteristics of pairing, it can be applied to
   construct several cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as
   identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption (ABE),
   authenticated key exchange (AKE), short signatures and so on.
   Several applications of pairing-based cryptography is now in
   practical use.

1.2.  Applications of Pairing-Based Cryptography

   Several applications using pairing-based cryptography are
   standardized and implemented.  We show example applications available
   in the real world.

   IETF issues RFCs for pairing-based cryptography such as identity-
   based cryptography [9], Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption (SAKKE) [10],
   and Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) [11].  SAKKE is
   applied to Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) [12] and used in 3GPP
   [13].

   Pairing-based key agreement protocols are standardized in ISO/IEC
   [14].  In [14], a key agreement scheme by Joux [15], identity-based
   key agreement schemes by Smart-Chen-Cheng [16] and by Fujioka-Suzuki-
   Ustaoglu [17] are specified.

   MIRACL implements M-Pin, a multi-factor authentication protocol [18].
   M-Pin protocol includes a kind of zero-knowledge proof, where pairing
   is used for its construction.

   Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifies ECDAA (Elliptic Curve Direct
   Anonymous Attestation) in the specification of Trusted Platform
   Module (TPM) [19].  ECDAA is a protocol for proving the attestation
   held by a TPM to a verifier without revealing the attestation held by
   that TPM.  Pairing is used for constructing ECDAA.  FIDO Alliance
   [20] and W3C [21] also published ECDAA algorithm similar to TCG.

   Zcash implements their own zero-knowledge proof algorithm named zk-
   SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of
   Knowledge) [22]. zk-SNARKs is used for protecting privacy of
   transactions of Zcash.  They use pairing for constructing zk-SNARKS.

   Cloudflare introduced Geo Key Manager [23] to restrict distribution
   of customers' private keys to the subset of their data centers.  To
   achieve this functionality, attribute-based encryption is used and
   pairing takes a role as a building block.

   Recently, Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature schemes are being
   standardized [24] and utilized in several blockchain projects such as
   Ethereum [25], Algorand [26], Chia Network [27] and DFINITY [28].
   The threshold functionality and aggregation functionality of BLS
   signatures are effective for their applications of decentralization
   and scalability.

1.3.  Goal

   The goal of this memo is to consider the security of pairing-friendly
   curves used in pairing-based cryptography and introduce secure
   parameters of pairing-frindly curves.  Specifically, we explain the
   recent attack against pairing-friendly curves and how much the
   security of the curves is reduced.  We show how to evaluate the
   security of pairing-friendly curves and give the parameters for 100
   bits of security, which is no longer secure, 128 and 256 bits of
   security.

1.4.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [1].

2.  Preliminaries

2.1.  Elliptic Curve

   Let p > 3 be a prime and F_p be a finite field.  The curve defined by
   the following equation E is called an elliptic curve.

      E : y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B,

   where A, B are in F_p and satisfies 4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 != 0 mod p.

   Solutions (x, y) for an elliptic curve E, as well as the point at
   infinity, O_E, are called F_p-rational points.  If P and Q are two
   points on the curve E, we can define R = P + Q as the opposite point
   of the intersection between the curve E and the line that intersects
   P and Q.  We can define P + O_E = P = O_E + P as well.  The additive
   group is constructed by the well-defined operation in the set of F_p-
   rational points.  Similarly, a scalar multiplication S = [a]P for a
   positive integer a can be defined as an a-time addition of P.

   Typically, the cyclic additive group with a prime order r and the
   base point G in its group is used for the elliptic curve

   cryptography.  Furthermore, we define terminology used in this memo
   as follows.

   O_E:  the point at infinity over an elliptic curve E.

   #E(F_p):  number of points on an elliptic curve E over F_p.

   h: a cofactor such that h = #E(F_p)/r.

   k: an embedding degree, a minimum integer such that r is a divisor of
      p^k - 1.

2.2.  Pairing

   Pairing is a kind of the bilinear map defined over an elliptic curve.
   Examples include Weil pairing, Tate pairing, optimal Ate pairing [2]
   and so on.  Especially, optimal Ate pairing is considered to be
   efficient to compute and mainly used for practical implementation.

   Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the prime field F_p.  Let G_1
   be a cyclic subgroup generated by a rational point on E with order r,
   and G_2 be a cyclic subgroup generated by a twisted curve E' of E
   with order r.  Let G_T be an order r subgroup of a field F_p^k, where
   k is an embedded degree.  Pairing is defined as a bilinear map e:
   (G_1, G_2) -> G_T satisfying the following properties:

   1.  Bilinearity: for any S in G_1, T in G_2, a, b in Z_r, we have the
       relation e([a]S, [b]T) = e(S, T)^{a * b}.

   2.  Non-degeneracy: for any T in G_2, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if S =
       O_E.  Similarly, for any S in G_1, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if T =
       O_E.

   3.  Computability: for any S in G_1 and T in G_2, the bilinear map is
       efficiently computable.

2.3.  Barreto-Naehrig Curve

   A BN curve [3] is one of the instantiations of pairing-friendly
   curves proposed in 2005.  A pairing over BN curves constructs optimal
   Ate pairings.

   A BN curve is an elliptic curve E defined over a finite field F_p,
   where p is more than or equal to 5, such that p and its order r are
   prime numbers parameterized by

       p = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 24 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1
       r = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 18 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2019


   for some well chosen integer t.  The elliptic curve has an equation
   of the form E: y^2 = x^3 + b, where b is an element of multiplicative
   group of order p.

   BN curves always have order 6 twists.  If m is an element which is
   neither a square nor a cube in a finite field F_p2, the twisted curve
   E' of E is defined over a finite field F_p2 by the equation E': y^2 =
   x^3 + b' with b' = b / m or b' = b * m.  The embedded degree k is 12.

   A pairing e is defined by taking G_1 as a cyclic group composed by
   rational points on the elliptic curve E, G_2 as a cyclic group
   composed by rational points on the elliptic curve E', and G_T as a
   multiplicative group of order p^12.

2.4.  Barreto-Lynn-Scott Curve

   A BLS curve [4] is another instantiations of pairings proposed in
   2002.  Similar to BN curves, a pairing over BLS curves constructs
   optimal Ate pairings.

   A BLS curve is an elliptic curve E defined over a finite field F_p by
   an equation of the form E: y^2 = x^3 + b and has a twist of order 6
   defined in the same way as BN curves.  In contrast to BN curves, a
   BLS curve does not have a prime order but its order is divisible by a
   large parameterized prime r and the pairing will be defined on the
   r-torsions points.

   BLS curves vary according to different embedding degrees.  In this
   memo, we deal with BLS12 and BLS48 families with embedding degrees 12
   and 48 with respect to r, respectively.

   In BLS curves, parameterized p and r are given by the following
   equations:

      BLS12:
          p = (t - 1)^2 * (t^4 - t^2 + 1) / 3 + t
          r = t^4 - t^2 + 1
      BLS48:
          p = (t - 1)^2 * (t^16 - t^8 + 1) / 3 + t
          r = t^16 - t^8 + 1

   for some well chosen integer t.

2.5.  Representation Convention for an Extension Field

   Pairing-friendly curves uses some extension fields.  In order to
   encode an element of an extension field, we adopt the convention
   shown in [29].

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2019


   For an element s of an extension field of degree d such that s = s_0
   + s_1 * i + s_2 * i^2 + ... + s_{d-1} * i^{d-1} for an indeterminant
   i, s is represented by

       s = s_0 + s_1 * p + s_2 * p^2 + ... + s_{d-1} * p^{d-1}.

   The parameters and test vectors of extension fields described in this
   memo are encoded by this convention and represented in octet stream.

3.  Security of Pairing-Friendly Curves

3.1.  Evaluating the Security of Pairing-Friendly Curves

   The security of pairing-friendly curves is evaluated by the hardness
   of the following discrete logarithm problems.

   -  The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in G_1 and
      G_2

   -  The finite field discrete logarithm problem (FFDLP) in G_T

   There are other hard problems over pairing-friendly curves, which are
   used for proving the security of pairing-based cryptography.  Such
   problems include computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman (CBDH) problem
   or bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) Problem, decision bilinear Diffie-
   Hellman (DBDH) problem, gap DBDH problem, etc [30].  Almost all of
   these variants are reduced to the hardness of discrete logarithm
   problems described above and believed to be easier than the discrete
   logarithm problems.

   There would be the case where the attacker solves these reduced
   problems to break the pairing-based cryptography.  Since such attacks
   have not been discovered yet, we discuss the hardness of the discrete
   logarithm problems in this memo.

   The security level of pairing-friendly curves is estimated by the
   computational cost of the most efficient algorithm to solve the above
   discrete logarithm problems.  The well-known algorithms for solving
   the discrete logarithm problems includes Pollard's rho algorithm
   [31], Index Calculus [32] and so on.  In order to make index calculus
   algorithms more efficient, number field sieve (NFS) algorithms are
   utilized.

   In addition, the special case where the cofactors of G_1, G_2 and G_T
   are small should be taken care [33].  In such case, the discrete
   logarithm problem can be efficiently solved.  One has to choose
   parameters so that the cofactors of G_1, G_2 and G_T contain no prime
   factors smaller than |G_1|, |G_2| and |G_T|.

3.2.  Impact of the Recent Attack

   In 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed a new variant of the NFS
   algorithms, the extended number field sieve (exTNFS), which
   drastically reduces the complexity of solving FFDLP [5].  Due to
   exTNFS, the security level of pairing-friendly curves asymptotically
   dropped down.  For instance, Barbulescu and Duquesne estimates that
   the security of the BN curves which was believed to provide 128 bits
   of security (BN256, for example) dropped down to approximately 100
   bits [6].

   Some papers show the minimum bitlength of the parameters of pairing-
   friendly curves for each security level when applying exTNFS as an
   attacking method for FFDLP.  For 128 bits of security, Menezes,
   Sarkar and Singh estimated the minimum bitlength of p of BN curves
   after exTNFS as 383 bits, and that of BLS12 curves as 384 bits [7].
   For 256 bits of security, Kiyomura et al. estimated the minimum
   bitlength of p^k of BLS48 curves as 27,410 bits, which implied 572
   bits of p [8].

4.  Security Evaluation of Pairing-Friendly Curves

   We give security evaluation for pairing-friendly curves based on the
   evaluating method presented in Section 3.  We also introduce secure
   parameters of pairing-friendly curves for each security level.  The
   parameters introduced here are chosen with the consideration of
   security, efficiency and global acceptance.

   For security, we introduce 100 bits, 128 bits and 256 bits of
   security.  We note that 100 bits of security is no longer secure and
   recommend 128 bits and 256 bits of security for secure applications.
   We follow TLS 1.3 [34] which specifies the cipher suites with 128
   bits and 256 bits of security as mandatory-to-implement for the
   choice of the security level.

   implementers of the applications have to choose the parameters with
   appropriate security level according to the security requirements of
   the applications.  For efficiency, we refer to the benchmark by mcl
   [35] for 128 bits of security, and by Kiyomura et al. [8] for 256
   bits of security and choose sufficiently efficient parameters.  For
   global acceptance, we give the implementations of pairing-friendly
   curves in Section 5.

4.1.  For 100 Bits of Security

   Before exTNFS, BN curves with 256-bit size of underlying finite field
   (so-called BN256) were considered to have 128 bits of security.




Yonezawa, et al.       Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2019


   After exTNFS, however, the security level of BN curves with 256-bit
   size of underlying finite field fell into 100 bits.

   implementers who will newly develop the applications of pairing-based
   cryptography SHOULD NOT use BN256 as a pairing-friendly curve when
   their applications require 128 bits of security.  In case an
   application does not require higher security level and is sufficient
   to have 100 bits of security (i.e.  Internet of Things), implementers
   MAY use BN256.

4.2.  For 128 Bits of Security

   A BN curve with 128 bits of security is shown in [6], which we call
   BN462.  BN462 is defined by a parameter t = 2^114 + 2^101 - 2^14 - 1
   for the definition in Section 2.3.  Defined by t, the elliptic curve
   E and its twisted curve E' are represented by E: y^2 = x^3 + 5 and
   E': y^2 = x^3 - u + 2, where u is an element of an extension field
   F_p^2, respectively.  The size of p becomes 462-bit length.

   For the finite field F_p, the towers of extension field F_p2, F_p6
   and F_p12 are defined by indeterminants u, v, w as follows:

       F_p2 = F_p[u] / (u^2 + 1)
       F_p6 = F_p2[v] / (v^3 - u - 2)
       F_p12 = F_p6[w] / (w^2 - v).

   As the parameters for BN462, we give a characteristic p, an order r,
   a base point G = (x, y), a cofactor h of an elliptic curve E: y^2 =
   x^3 + b, and an order r', a base point G' = (x', y'), a cofactor h'
   of an elliptic curve E': y^2 = x^3 + b'.

   A BLS12 curve with 128 bits of security shown in [36], BLS12-381, is
   defined by a parameter t = -2^63 - 2^62 - 2^60 - 2^57 - 2^48 - 2^16
   and the size of p becomes 381-bit length.  Defined by t, the elliptic
   curve E and its twisted curve E' are represented by E: y^2 = x^3 + 4
   and E': y^2 = x^3 + 4(u + 1), where u is an element of an extension
   field F_p^2, respectively.

   For the finite field F_p, the towers of extension field F_p2, F_p6
   and F_p12 are defined by indeterminants u, v, w as follows:

       F_p2 = F_p[u] / (u^2 + 1)
       F_p6 = F_p2[v] / (v^3 - u - 1)
       F_p12 = F_p6[w] / (w^2 - v).

   We have to note that, according to [7], the bit length of p for BLS12
   to achieve 128 bits of security is calculated as 384 bits and more,
   which BLS12-381 does not satisfy.  Although the computational time is
   conservatively estimated by 2^110 when exTNFS is applied with index
   calculus, there is no currently published efficient method for such
   computational time.  They state that BLS12-381 achieves 127-bit
   security level evaluated by the computational cost of Pollard's rho.
   Therefore, we regard BN462 as a "conservative" parameter, and
   BLS12-381 as an "optimistic" parameter.

4.3.  For 256 Bits of Security

   As shown in Section 3.2, it is unrealistic to achieve 256 bits of
   security by BN curves since the minimum size of p becomes too large
   to implement.  Hence, we consider BLS48 for 256 bits of security.

   A BLS48 curve with 256 bits of security is shown in [8], which we
   call BLS48-581.  It is defined by a parameter t = -1 + 2^7 - 2^10 -
   2^30 - 2^32 and the elliptic curve E and its twisted curve E' are
   represented by E: y^2 = x^3 + 1 and E': y^2 = x^3 - 1 / w, where w is

   an element of an extension field F_p^8.  The size of p becomes
   581-bit length.

   For the finite field F_p, the towers of extension field F_p2, F_p4,
   F_p8, F_p24 and F_p48 are defined by indeterminants u, v, w, z, s as
   follows:

       F_p2 = F_p[u] / (u^2 + 1)
       F_p4 = F_p2[v] / (v^2 + u + 1)
       F_p8 = F_p4[w] / (w^2 + v)
       F_p24 = F_p8[z] / (z^3 + w)
       F_p48 = Fp24[s] / (s^2 + z)

   We then give the parameters for BLS48-581 as follows.

5.  Implementations of Pairing-Friendly Curves

   We show the pairing-friendly curves selected by existing standards,
   applications and cryptographic libraries.

   ISO/IEC 15946-5 [37] shows examples of BN curves with the size of
   160, 192, 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits of p.  There is no action so far
   after the proposal of exTNFS.

   TCG adopts an BN curve of 256 bits specified in ISO/IEC 15946-5
   (TPM_ECC_BN_P256) and of 638 bits specified by their own
   (TPM_ECC_BN_P638).  FIDO Alliance [20] and W3C [21] adopt the BN
   curves specified in TCG, a 512-bit BN curve shown in ISO/IEC 15946-5
   and another 256-bit BN curve.

   MIRACL [38] implements BN curves and BLS12 curves.

   Zcash implemented a BN curve (named BN128) in their library libsnark
   [39].  After exTNFS, they propose a new parameter of BLS12 as
   BLS12-381 [36] and publish its experimental implementation [40].

   Cloudflare implements a 256-bit BN curve (bn256) [41].  There is no
   action so far after exTNFS.

   Ethereum 2.0 adopts BLS12-381 (BLS12_381), BN curves with 254 bits of
   p (CurveFp254BNb) and 382 bits of p (CurveFp382_1 and CurveFp382_2)
   [42].  Their implementation calls mcl [35] for pairing computation.
   Chia Network publishs their implementation [27] by integrating the
   RELIC toolkit [44].

   Cryptographic libraries which implement pairings include PBC [43],
   mcl [35], RELIC [44], TEPLA [45], AMCL [46], Intel IPP [47] and a
   library by Kyushu University [48].

   Table 1 shows the adoption of pairing-friendly curves in existing
   standards, applications and libraries.  In this table, the curves
   marked as (*) indicate that there is no research result on the
   security evaluation, but that the implementers states that they hold
   128 bits of security.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo entirely describes the security of pairing-friendly curves,
   and introduces secure parameters of pairing-friendly curves.  We give
   these parameters in terms of security, efficiency and global
   acceptance.  The parameters for 100, 128 and 256 bits of security are
   introduced since the security level will different in the
   requirements of the pairing-based applications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

8.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Akihiro Kato for his significant
   contribution to the early version of this memo.

Appendix A.  Computing Optimal Ate Pairing

   Before presenting the computation of optimal Ate pairing e(P, Q)
   satisfying the properties shown in Section 2.2, we give subfunctions
   used for pairing computation.

   The following algorithm Line_Function shows the computation of the
   line function.  It takes A = (A[1], A[2]), B = (B[1], B[2]) in G_2
   and P = ((P[1], P[2])) in G_1 as input and outputs an element of G_T.

       if (A = B) then
           l := (3 * A[1]^2) / (2 * A[2]);
       else if (A = -B) then
           return P[1] - A[1];
       else
           l := (B[2] - A[2]) / (B[1] - A[1]);
       end if;
       return (l * (P[1] -A[1]) + A[2] -P[2]);

   When implementing the line function, implementer should consider the
   isomorphism of E and its twisted curve E' so that one can reduce the
   computational cost of operations in G_2.  We note that the function
   Line_function does not consider such isomorphism.

   Computation of optimal Ate pairing for BN curves uses Frobenius map.
   Let a Frobenius map pi for a point Q = (x, y) over E' be pi(p, Q) =
   (x^p, y^p).

A.1.  Optimal Ate Pairings over Barreto-Naehrig Curves

   Let s = 6 * t + 2 for a parameter t and s_0, s_1, ... , s_L in
   {-1,0,1} such that the sum of s_i * 2^i (i = 0, 1, ..., L) equals to
   s.

   The following algorithm shows the computation of optimal Ate pairing
   over Barreto-Naehrig curves.  It takes P in G_1, Q in G_2, an integer
   s, s_0, ...,s_L in {-1,0,1} such that the sum of s_i * 2^i (i = 0, 1,
   ..., L) equals to s, and an order r as input, and outputs e(P, Q).

       f := 1; T := Q;
       if (s_L = -1)
           T := -T;
       end if
       for i = L-1 to 0
           f := f^2 * Line_function(T, T, P); T := 2 * T;
           if (s_i = 1 | s_i = -1)
               f := f * Line_function(T, s_i * Q); T := T + s_i * Q;
           end if
       end for
       Q_1 := pi(p, Q); Q_2 := pi(p, Q_1);
       f := f * Line_function(T, Q_1, P); T := T + Q_1;
       f := f * Line_function(T, -Q_2, P);
       f := f^{(p^k - 1) / r}
       return f;

A.2.  Optimal Ate Pairings over Barreto-Lynn-Scott Curves

   Let s = t for a parameter u and s_0, s_1, ... , s_L in {-1,0,1} be a
   sign-digit representation of s such that the sum of s_i * 2^i (i = 0,
   1, ..., L) equals to s.  The following algorithm shows the
   computation of optimal Ate pairing over Barreto-Lynn-Scott curves.
   It takes P in G_1, Q in G_2, a parameter s, s_0, s_1, ..., s_L in
   {-1,0,1} such that the sum of s_i * 2^i (i = 0, 1, ..., L), and an
   order r as input, and outputs e(P, Q).

       f := 1; T := Q;
       if (s_L = -1)
           T := -T;
       end if
       for i = L-1 to 0
           f := f^2 * Line_function(T, T, P); T := 2 * T;
           if (s_i = 1 | s_i = -1)
               f := f * Line_function(T, s_i * Q, P); T := T + s_i * Q;
           end if
       end for
       f := f^{(p^k - 1) / r};
       return f;
